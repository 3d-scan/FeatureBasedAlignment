Feature Based Alignment

Some programs to roughly align two point clouds representing the same underlying geometry.
The goal is to accurately register two point clouds created from different image spectrums 
(e.g. visual to infrared), in different coordinate systems of different scales.  

Current approach is:
- Take two point clouds 
- Estimate normals for each point
- Find FPFH Features for each point
- Find likely correspondences between two models (based on FPFH)
- Use top features to estimate scale, 
- Run RANSAC to estimate transformation, and eliminate correspondences
- Use remaining correspondences to run ICP for finer alignment


Usage Example:
#estimate correspondences
./corrs cloudA.ply cloudB.ply AtoBCorrs.txt

#run rough alignment
./align cloudA.ply cloudB.ply AtoBCorrs.txt

#saves files:
irRough.pcd - cloud A after RANSAC alignment
eoRough.pcd - cloud B after RANSAC alignment
irFinal.pcd - cloud A after ICP alignment
eoFinal.pcd - cloud B after ICP alignment
